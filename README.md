# Fidget App
A Flutter based app with fidgets that vibrate.

# Who is this for?
Some people might find the vibration relaxing to the touch, or just need to do a repetitive movement that isn't a full body activity.

# How do I install this?
Currently you have to download the repository and build the application yourself. You need to own a MacBook if you want to compile for iOS. Just Google the instructions and you'll get there.

# Contribute
You're welcome to contribute with ideas or even submit a pull request with a new fidget.
